"Sampling overview per site, per month",,,,
Methods ,Reps,Duration,Vegetation measurements,Spacing
Pitfalls,"12 under shrubs, 12 in open",72 hours,"Shrub x, y, z","Set out along a line, 10 m between focal shrubs. Opens paired with shrub."
,,,"Quadrats (shrub, open)","If an unshrubbed site, set two lines of traps, all 10 m apart "
Malaise,"1 in central location, shrubbed area",72 hours,None,Set up one halfway along pitfall line in a shrubbed area. Add a sign to the malaise saying it is for research.
Shrubs - Sweep netting,"10 shrubs, 1 min per shrub","2 x, once per day","Shrub x, y, z",10 m between focal shrubs within a day.
,,,Quadrat,"Pick different shrubs each day, spread them around the site if possible, Skip at unshrubbed"
Transects - sweep,10 transects of 25 sweeps (90 seconds),"2 x, once per day",None,"Keep three meters apart min for paired transects, spread out the pairs throughout the study site. "
Transects - search and scare,10 transects of 25 sweeps (90 seconds),"2 x, once per day",None,"Keep three meters apart min for paired transects, spread out the pairs throughout the study site. "
Free form collecting,"15 minutes, 2 people ","2 x, once per day",None,Wherever you see insects. Ignore ants & flies. Check microhabitats not considered. Goal is to catch insects the other surveys might have missed.

Vegetation,"10 x 25 m transects, 6 quadrats per transect (60 q per site)",Once per month,Quadrats,"Every 4 m along transects, spread them out around the study site"
